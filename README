== UV Squares ==
  features:
    - reshapes selected UV faces to grid of perfect squares - [alt+E]
    - aligns selected UV vertices to a line - [alt+E] (hit twice for equal distances between verts)
    - rips/joins selected UV faces - [alt+V]/[shift+alt+V]
    
  notes:
    -align to line hit once is same as
      - set pivot to cursor (sets it back after)
      - scale, restrict to axis (recognize X or Y by the slope) and 0 to cursor
      
    -selection should be under ~512 faces at the time
